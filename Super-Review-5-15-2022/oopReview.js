// OOP Review - 7:25
// encapsulation - brining all functions into one spot - keeps our code more organized
// makes it easier to add new stuff, esaier to read through what was already coded, and made it so you were not afraid to make changes

// abstraction -hiding complex or unnecessary details are hidden, DO stuff once,
// breaks our code down into more manageable pieces of code
// make code changes and still sleep at night

// Inheritance - create new objects based on old ones, we can eliminate a bunch of redundant code
// eliminate redundant code

// Polymorphism - instead of conditionals and switch, -
// no need to update everything in code and helps support other pillars of OOP
