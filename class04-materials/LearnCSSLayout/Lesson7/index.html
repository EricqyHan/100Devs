   <div class="static">
      <p>static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static
         element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be
         positioned.

   <div class="relative1">
      <p>Relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties</p>
   </div>
   <div class="relative2">
      <p>
         Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be
         adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the
         element.
      </p>
   </div>

   <div class="relative">
      <p>This element is relatively-positioned. If this element was position: static; its absolutely-positioned child
         would
         escape and would be positioned relative to the document body.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="absolute">
      This element is absolutely-positioned. It's positioned relative to its parent.
