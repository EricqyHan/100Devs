   <!-- Static -->
   <!-- <div class="static">
      static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static
      element is
      said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned.
   </div> -->

   <!-- Relative -->
   <!-- <div class="relative1">
      relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties
   </div>
   <div class="relative2">
      Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be
      adjusted away
      from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
   </div> -->

   <div class="relative">
      This element is relatively-positioned. If this element was position: static; its absolutely-positioned child would
      escape and would be positioned relative to the document body.
   </div>
   <div class="absolute">
      This element is absolutely-positioned. It's positioned relative to it's parent.

   <div class="fixed">
      Hello! Don't pay attention to me yet!
